# Malaria-TDFS

This is collab notebook that uses the Malaria dataset provided in TensorFlow Datasets.

This dataset has an equal number of parasited and uninfected images which is something noteworthy as probaly a real life dataset/sample provided by a lab wouldn't have this high percentage of parasited images.  The images were provided by the National Library of Medicine which has 27,558 training images.

The deep learning model uses a function to create the convulational network and then followed by a set of full connected dense layers.

If you have any questions or suggestions to this model please don't hesitate to drop me a line.
