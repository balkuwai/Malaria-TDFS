# Malaria-TDFS

This is a collab notebook that uses the Malaria dataset provided in TensorFlow Datasets.

This dataset has an equal number of parasited and uninfected images which is something noteworthy as probaly a real life dataset/sample provided by a lab wouldn't have this high percentage of parasited images.  The images were provided by the National Library of Medicine which has 27,558 training images.

The deep learning model uses a function to create the convolutional network and then followed by a set of fully connected dense layers.

If you have any questions or suggestions to this model please don't hesitate to drop me a line.

You should really go through the Jupyter notebook as it has all my comments in it but I also provided the same code in .py format in case you don't want to run it in a notebook.
